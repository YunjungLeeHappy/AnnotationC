","""The ground suddenly disappeared.
When Jung Dawoon came to, he knew it was already hopeless.

[Oopsie, be careful! Historic sites like these always have just as many traps as treasures! It's one of the rules of the dungeon, you know!]
The annoyingly cheery voice echoed from a distance.
That damned assistant only offered advice after someone died.
Jung Dawoon was at the bottom of a deep pit.
The ground was covered in sharp, metal spikes
One of the spikes had pierced his stomach. Jung Dawoon was dying.
“Damn it.""""
With the last of his strength, he pulled the spike from his body.
He then crawled across the floor and leaned against the wall.
Weakly, he looked up and saw a circle of light at the end of the deep darkness.
It was the opening of the trap he'd fallen into.

To think some treasure blinded me when I'd gotten so far...
His regret was palpable.
He had no one to blame; it had been his own mistake that had doomed him.
So this is how I die?
His vision began to fade.
He must have lost too much blood.
His body was getting progressively colder.
There was a ringing in his ears, and his head was blank.
His senses were growing dull, and everything felt far away.
He'd struggled so much to survive, but now he was at death's door.
Was any of this real in the first place? It's like I've been living in a nightmare since I got here.
Indeed.""

Historic sites like these always have just as many traps as treasures! It's one of the rules of the dungeon, you know!]\nThe annoyingly cheery voice echoed from a distance.\nThat damned assistant only offered advice after someone died.\nJung Dawoon was at the bottom of a deep pit.\nThe ground was covered in sharp, metal spikes\nOne of the spikes had pierced his stomach. Jung Dawoon was dying.\nâ€œDamn it.\"\nWith the last of his strength, he pulled the spike from his body.\nHe then crawled across the floor and leaned against the wall.\nWeakly, he looked up and saw a circle of light at the end of the deep darkness.\nIt was the opening of the trap he'd fallen into.\nTo think some treasure blinded me when I'd gotten so far...\nHis regret was palpable.\nHe had no one to blame; it had been his own mistake that had doomed him.\nSo this is how I die?\nHis vision began to fade.\nHe must have lost too much blood.\nHis body was getting progressively colder.\nThere was a ringing in his ears, and his head was blank.\nHis senses were growing dull, and everything felt far away.\nHe'd struggled so much to survive, but now he was at death's door."

  "novel_txt": "\"Aria! Aria!\"\nCrash!\nA glass fell from Aria's hands to the ground, shattering into dozens of pieces. A maid immediately rushed towards her and started to sweep up the mess.\nAria was momentarily stunned. Coming to her senses, she looked towards the voice calling her. It was Mielle, her delicate force looking worried as her eyes filled with tears across the marble table.\nMielle was as delicately beautiful as ever. Even at Aria's execution she had looked fragile, almost ethereal.\nHow does she look so young...?!\nAs far as Aria could remember, Mielle was twenty- three years old. But the Mielle sitting in front of her looked barely a day past ten.\nNext to her was Cain, who was glaring at Aria with a disapproving frown. He too looked young, perhaps sixteen or seventeen.\nUnable to understand what she was seeing, Aria just blinked. Then came a cold voice from right beside her.\n\"Are you all right, Aria? Why weren't you answering me?\""

  "novel_txt": "When I saw the snowwhite school uniform that hung from the closet door, I found myself at a loss, however.\nHuh? Brows deeply furrowed, I stared at the uniform for a while. I rubbed my eyes. Nothing changed, so this time I tried banging my head against the wall. When I turned towards the closet again, I saw the same uniform hanging there.\nWhat is this? I thought, holding the uniform. It resembled a patient's gown from some psychiatric ward the more I looked at it. The jacket was pure white, and so was the dress. The vest was a light beige, but that wasn't much of a consolation. If I put this on and buttoned my jacket, I'd be white from head to toe.\nOne thing I found a relief was that this was not my school's uniform. My school's uniform came in an ordinary navy color.\nI stood there staring vacantly for a while before calling out to my mom.\n\"Mom, where's my uniform?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nMy mom, having just finished doing the dishes in the kitchen, appeared at my door. I shook the white uniform at her.\n\"Mom, this isn't my school's uniform! Where's mine?\"\n\"What are you saying, child? You went to get that fitted last week. That is your uniform!\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What?\""
